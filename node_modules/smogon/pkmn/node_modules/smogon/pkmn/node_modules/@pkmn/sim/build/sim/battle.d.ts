    /**
     * runEvent is the core of Pokemon Showdown's event system.
     *
     * Basic usage
     * ===========
     *
     *   this.runEvent('Blah')
     * will trigger any onBlah global event handlers.
     *
     *   this.runEvent('Blah', target)
     * will additionally trigger any onBlah handlers on the target, onAllyBlah
     * handlers on any active pokemon on the target's team, and onFoeBlah
     * handlers on any active pokemon on the target's foe's team
     *
     *   this.runEvent('Blah', target, source)
     * will additionally trigger any onSourceBlah handlers on the source
     *
     *   this.runEvent('Blah', target, source, effect)
     * will additionally pass the effect onto all event handlers triggered
     *
     *   this.runEvent('Blah', target, source, effect, relayVar)
     * will additionally pass the relayVar as the first argument along all event
     * handlers
     *
     * You may leave any of these null. For instance, if you have a relayVar but
     * no source or effect:
     *   this.runEvent('Damage', target, null, null, 50)
     *
     * Event handlers
     * ==============
     *
     * Items, abilities, statuses, and other effects like SR, confusion, weather,
     * or Trick Room can have event handlers. Event handlers are functions that
     * can modify what happens during an event.
     *
     * event handlers are passed:
     *   function (target, source, effect)
     * although some of these can be blank.
     *
     * certain events have a relay variable, in which case they're passed:
     *   function (relayVar, target, source, effect)
     *
     * Relay variables are variables that give additional information about the
     * event. For instance, the damage event has a relayVar which is the amount
     * of damage dealt.
     *
     * If a relay variable isn't passed to runEvent, there will still be a secret
     * relayVar defaulting to `true`, but it won't get passed to any event
     * handlers.
     *
     * After an event handler is run, its return value helps determine what
     * happens next:
     * 1. If the return value isn't `undefined`, relayVar is set to the return
     *    value
     * 2. If relayVar is falsy, no more event handlers are run
     * 3. Otherwise, if there are more event handlers, the next one is run and
     *    we go back to step 1.
     * 4. Once all event handlers are run (or one of them results in a falsy
     *    relayVar), relayVar is returned by runEvent
     *
     * As a shortcut, an event handler that isn't a function will be interpreted
     * as a function that returns that value.
     *
     * You can have return values mean whatever you like, but in general, we
     * follow the convention that returning `false` or `null` means
     * stopping or interrupting the event.
     *
     * For instance, returning `false` from a TrySetStatus handler means that
     * the pokemon doesn't get statused.
     *
     * If a failed event usually results in a message like "But it failed!"
     * or "It had no effect!", returning `null` will suppress that message and
     * returning `false` will display it. Returning `null` is useful if your
     * event handler already gave its own custom failure message.
     *
     * Returning `undefined` means "don't change anything" or "keep going".
     * A function that does nothing but return `undefined` is the equivalent
     * of not having an event handler at all.
     *
     * Returning a value means that that value is the new `relayVar`. For
     * instance, if a Damage event handler returns 50, the damage event
     * will deal 50 damage instead of whatever it was going to deal before.
     *
     * Useful values
     * =============
     *
     * In addition to all the methods and attributes of Dex, Battle, and
     * Scripts, event handlers have some additional values they can access:
     *
     * this.effect:
     *   the Effect having the event handler
     * this.effectData:
     *   the data store associated with the above Effect. This is a plain Object
     *   and you can use it to store data for later event handlers.
     * this.effectData.target:
     *   the Pokemon, Side, or Battle that the event handler's effect was
     *   attached to.
     * this.event.id:
     *   the event ID
     * this.event.target, this.event.source, this.event.effect:
     *   the target, source, and effect of the event. These are the same
     *   variables that are passed as arguments to the event handler, but
     *   they're useful for functions called by the event handler.
