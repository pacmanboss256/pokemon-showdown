It also has a high Special Attack stat, which lets it hit hard against Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> with its coverage moves. Counter in combination with Focus Sash and Magic Guard helps Alakazam beat threatening physical attackers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/sharpedo\" hreflang=\"en\">Sharpedo</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/cinderace\" hreflang=\"en\">Cinderace</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>. Expanding Force is its STAB move of choice and is boosted to crazy levels in Psychic Terrain, letting Alakazam OHKO Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dracovish\" hreflang=\"en\">Dracovish</a> after minor chip damage. It can also 2HKO Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scizor\" hreflang=\"en\">Scizor</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/araquanid\" hreflang=\"en\">Araquanid</a> if they switch in against it. Dazzling Gleam can be used to beat Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/crawdaunt\" hreflang=\"en\">Crawdaunt</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu</a>, and Hydreigon. Shadow Ball lets Alakazam do good damage to Pokemon weak to it like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/raichu-alola\" hreflang=\"en\">Alolan Raichu</a>. Focus Blast, on the other hand, lets Alakazam threaten Ferrothorn and Tyranitar, which can stomach its other moves easily. Alakazam should not take any unnecessary damage that may result from directly switching it into opposing Pokemon, as they may leave it unable to retain its Focus Sash. Also, it should be preserved in matchups against Bug- and Dark-type teams where it is needed to take on threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scolipede\" hreflang=\"en\">Scolipede</a> and Sharpedo. Maximum Special Attack investment optimizes Alakazam's overall damage output. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets it outspeed comparably fast Pokemon such as Cinderace and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salazzle\" hreflang=\"en\">Salazzle</a>.</p>\n<p>Alakazam's teammates appreciate its role as a revenge killer being able to take on problematic Pokemon. Teammates like Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/indeedee\" hreflang=\"en\">Indeedee-M</a> and Nasty Plot <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mew\" hreflang=\"en\">Mew</a> can wallbreak opposing foes, making Alakazam's job easier as a revenge killer late-game. Indeedee-M is a notable teammate, as it provides it with Ghost-type immunity and Psychic Terrain support, making the team immune to threatening priority moves like Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak from Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/bisharp\" hreflang=\"en\">Bisharp</a>, Aegislash, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mimikyu\" hreflang=\"en\">Mimikyu</a>, allowing Alakazam to deal with such threats much better. Nasty Plot Mew, meanwhile, can take care of the Steel-type matchup by taking on Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and Ferrothorn that may be an obstacle for Alakazam late-game. Support teammates like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/orbeetle\" hreflang=\"en\">Orbeetle</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celebi\" hreflang=\"en\">Celebi</a> provide Sticky Web and Stealth Rock support, enabling Alakazam to outspeed faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gengar\" hreflang=\"en\">Gengar</a> and score easier KO with Expanding Force against Azumarill under Psychic Terrain. Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a> can spread paralysis and bring Alakazam onto the field safely with Teleport, acting as a defensive pivot for the team. Choice Scarf users like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gardevoir\" hreflang=\"en\">Gardevoir</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> are good teammates, as the former can deal with weather sweepers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kingdra\" hreflang=\"en\">Kingdra</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/barraskewda\" hreflang=\"en\">Barraskewda</a>, and Excadrill, while the latter does a good job against Fairy- and Ice-type teams, beating Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/cloyster\" hreflang=\"en\">Cloyster</a>, which can otherwise beat Alakazam with its multi-hit moves especially after Shell Smash boost. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> and Alakazam form a great core against offensive types like Dark, Dragon, and Electric where Hatterene can break teams with its defensive Calm Mind set, letting Alakazam clean up late-game.</p>\n","abilities":["Magic Guard"],"items":["Focus Sash"],"moveslots":[[{"move":"Counter","type":null}],[{"move":"Expanding Force","type":null}],[{"move":"Dazzling Gleam","type":null},{"move":"Shadow Ball","type":null}],[{"move":"Focus Blast","type":null}]],"evconfigs":[{"hp":0,"atk":0,"def":0,"spa":252,"spd":4,"spe":252}],"ivconfigs":[],"natures":["Timid"]}],"credits":{"teams":[{"name":"Psychic analysis by","members":[{"user_id":320110,"username":"Harpp"}]},{"name":"Quality checked by","members":[{"user_id":391540,"username":"Havens"},{"user_id":362454,"username":"Decem"}]},{"name":"Grammar checked by","members":[{"user_id":240732,"username":"Estronic"}]}],"writtenBy":[{"user_id":320110,"username":"Harpp"}]}},{"format":"Doubles","overview":"","comments":"","movesets":[{"name":"Attacker","pokemon":"Alakazam","shiny":false,"gender":"DC","level":0,"description":"<p>This is a sample set while we are currently working on analyses in <a href=\"http://www.smogon.com/forums/forums/doubles-ou-analyses.541/\">Contributions and Corrections</a>.</p>\n","abilities":["Magic Guard"],"items":["Life Orb","Choice Scarf"],"moveslots":[[{"move":"Expanding Force","type":null}],[{"move":"Dazzling Gleam","type":null},{"move":"Focus Blast","type":null}],[{"move":"Substitute","type":null},{"move":"Focus Blast","type":null}],[{"move":"Protect","type":null},{"move":"Trick","type":null}]],"evconfigs":[{"hp":0,"atk":0,"def":4,"spa":252,"spd":0,"spe":252}],"ivconfigs":[{"hp":31,"atk":0,"def":31,"spa":31,"spd":31,"spe":31}],"natures":["Timid"]}],"credits":{"teams":[],"writtenBy":[]}},{"format":"STABmons","overview":"","comments":"","movesets":[{"name":"Life Orb","pokemon":"Alakazam","shiny":false,"gender":"DC","level":0,"description":"","abilities":["Magic Guard"],"items":["Life Orb"],"moveslots":[[{"move":"Nasty Plot","type":null}],[{"move":"Psystrike","type":null},{"move":"Photon Geyser","type":null}],[{"move":"Focus Blast","type":null}],[{"move":"Shadow Ball","type":null}]],"evconfigs":[{"hp":0,"atk":0,"def":0,"spa":252,"spd":4,"spe":252}],"ivconfigs":[],"natures":["Timid"]},{"name":"Focus Sash","pokemon":"Alakazam","shiny":false,"gender":"DC","level":0,"description":"<p>These are sample sets while we work on <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/forums/575/\">new analyses</a> for the post-DLC meta.
